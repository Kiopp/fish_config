# ML4W dotfiles fish shell config
Personal configurations for the fish shell to be integrated with the ml4w dotfiles for hyprland.
## Current features:
### ML4W dotfiles bash parity
* oh-my-posh prompt theme
* fastfetch on new terminal session
* Some of the shell aliases (only the ones I use)
### Personal configuration
* Override the cd command to also run ls
